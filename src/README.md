<br/><yellow>WORDLE PROJECT</yellow>: <br/><br/>&nbsp;This project is supposed to be 
an imitation of the web-based word game called 
"Wordle"!!

<yellow>DESCRIPTION</yellow>: <br/><br/>&nbsp;This is a guessing game,
so you have a word that you are trying to guess
correctly. You have multiple chances to guess the word
correctly. The program is supposed to compare your guess
against the word and help direct you in your future guesses based on the occurrences
and placement of your letters through highlighting. 
<br/><br/>Highlighted <u>Green</u> if the letter is lined up properly
<br/><br/>Highlighted <u>Yellow</u> if letter is in the word but in the wrong spot
<br/><br/>Highlighted <u>Black</u> if letter is not in the word

<br><yellow>CHALLENGES</yellow>:
<br><br>&nbsp;Unfortunately the project isn't 100% completed
I still have to code in the prompts for the user and make some
more function calls. However, it seems to be highlighting correctly
which is great!

<br><yellow>HOW TO USE</yellow>:
<br><br>&nbsp;For now the code is only capable of comparing your
guess and the word through the highlighting. So in main() you can see that I have
a couple calls to the gameState() function and printing
them out to the terminal. You are welcome to try some more calls
using a different word and guess. However,
just make sure that your guess and your word are both 5-letter 
words otherwise it will break the code because of
fixed array size.
